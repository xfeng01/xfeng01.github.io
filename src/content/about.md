**Hi, I‚Äôm a first-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA.**

Before joining UCLA, I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Chongqing University. I am a member of both the [**Wireless Lab at UCLA**](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/) and the [**W&M Data-Driven Decision Intelligence (D3I) Lab**](https://haipeng-chen.github.io/). 

Currently, I am expanding my research experience in both wireless communications and artificial intelligence.

I am driven by a passion for advancing technology and a long-term goal of contributing to the development of next-generation mobile communication systems and promoting AI-enabled communication network design.

My research interests include:
- **Wireless communications**: Focusing on the development of efficient, reliable, and secure wireless communication systems.
- **Optimization**: Exploring advanced algorithms to enhance the performance of complex systems.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Investigating AI techniques to improve decision-making in dynamic environments.
