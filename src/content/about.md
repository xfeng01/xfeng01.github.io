Hi, I’m a first-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA. 

Before joining UCLA, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Chongqing University. I am a member of both the Wireless Lab at UCLA and the W&M Data-Driven Decision Intelligence (D3I) Lab. 

Currently, I am enhancing foundational capabilities in wireless communications and conducting fundamental research in reinforcement learning.

My research interest includes:
- Wireless communications
- Optimization
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
