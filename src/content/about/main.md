Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at William & Mary (2025–), advised by Prof. Haipeng Chen at the [Data-Driven Decision Intelligence (D3I) Lab](https://haipeng-chen.github.io/).
I received my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA (2023–2025), where I was a member of the [Wireless Lab at UCLA](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Ian P. Roberts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDAx4ycAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
I received my B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Chongqing University (2019–2023).

My current research focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), generative AI, and large language models (LLMs).
In RL, my interests span theoretical foundations, new algorithmic designs, and applications to complex optimization problems.
In generative AI, my focus is on ODE-based generative models, where I seek to better understand their underlying theoretical principles and design new algorithms to improve both performance and efficiency.
For LLMs, I am currently exploring diffusion-based language models and their potential integration with reinforcement learning.
Previously, I worked on wireless communications, and I remain interested in exploring opportunities to apply AI methods to this domain.
