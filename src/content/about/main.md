Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at William & Mary (2025–), advised by Prof. Haipeng Chen at the [Data-Driven Decision Intelligence (D3I) Lab](https://haipeng-chen.github.io/).
I received my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA (2023–2025), where I was a member of the [Wireless Lab at UCLA](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Ian P. Roberts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RDAx4ycAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Chongqing University (2019–2023).

My research primarily focuses on **diffusion-based language models**, where I design practical decoding algorithms (e.g., adaptive re-masking, embedding/rounding) and apply reinforcement learning for post-training to refine these strategies.
Beyond this, I am also interested in **reinforcement learning theory and algorithms** for complex optimization, as well as ODE-based **generative models** for efficient and high-performing generation.
Previously, I worked on wireless communications, and I remain interested in opportunities to apply AI methods in this domain.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in further discussion or potential collaboration.
