We propose **Wake-Sleep Option (WS-option)**, a *hierarchical reinforcement learning* framework that jointly optimizes budget allocation and node selection via a two-layer MDP formulation.
By incorporating stability- and efficiency-oriented designs, WS-option achieves superior performance and generalization over prior methods, and scales effectively to larger graphs.
