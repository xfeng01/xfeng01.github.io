**Hi, I'm a second-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA.**

Before joining UCLA, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Chongqing University. I am a member of both the [**Wireless Lab at UCLA**](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/) and the [**W&M Data-Driven Decision Intelligence (D3I) Lab**](https://haipeng-chen.github.io/). 

Currently, I am expanding my research experience in both wireless communications and artificial intelligence.
I am driven by a passion for advancing technology and a long-term goal of contributing to the development of next-generation mobile communication systems and promoting AI-enabled communication network design.

My research focuses on the intersection of wireless communications, optimization, and artificial intelligence, aiming to address complex challenges in next-generation communication systems and AI-driven network design.
- **Wireless communications**: I am interested in using machine learning to solve practical challenges in wireless communication, exploring semantic communication and semantic information theory for AI integration, and advancing technologies like full-duplex communication, joint communication and sensing, and implantable medical devices.
- **Optimization**: My work focuses on combinatorial and intelligent optimization algorithms, particularly their applications in communication networks and decision-making systems.
- **AI**: My interests include reinforcement learning, generative AI, graph neural networks, and the theoretical foundations of AI, with a particular focus on AI for wireless communication and wireless communication for AI, such as semantic communication integration.
