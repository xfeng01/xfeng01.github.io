**Hi, I‚Äôm a second-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA.**

Before joining UCLA, I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Chongqing University. I am a member of both the [**Wireless Lab at UCLA**](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/) and the [**W&M Data-Driven Decision Intelligence (D3I) Lab**](https://haipeng-chen.github.io/). 

Currently, I am expanding my research experience in both wireless communications and artificial intelligence.
I am driven by a passion for advancing technology and a long-term goal of contributing to the development of next-generation mobile communication systems and promoting AI-enabled communication network design.

My research focuses on the intersection of wireless communications, optimization, and artificial intelligence, aiming to address complex challenges in next-generation communication systems and AI-driven network design.
- **Wireless communications**: I am interested in using machine learning to solve practical challenges in wireless communication, exploring semantic communication and semantic information theory for AI integration, and advancing technologies like full-duplex communication, joint communication and sensing, and implantable medical devices.
- **Optimization**: My work focuses on combinatorial and intelligent optimization algorithms, particularly their applications in communication networks and decision-making systems.
- **AI**: My interests include reinforcement learning, generative AI, graph neural networks, and the theoretical foundations of AI, with a particular focus on AI for wireless communication and wireless communication for AI, such as semantic communication integration.

For more details about my background and projects, please feel free to check out my [CV](/Xinsong_Feng_CV.pdf).

**Beyond academics**, I enjoy cooking and often hear from my friends that my dishes are exceptionally delicious. 
To me, the whole process feels like reinforcement learning‚Äîadding spices is like tuning model parameters, and the final taste is the reward. 
The recipe I write down afterward is essentially the saved optimal model parameters. 
I also love drawing, particularly anime characters. 
Playing the piano is another passion of mine‚Äîit became my favorite way to enjoy music since I tend to sing off-key! 
Table tennis, on the other hand, is the only sport that keeps me active, as I rarely exercise otherwise.
